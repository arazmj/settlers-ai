    /// Calculates the longest road using Depth-First Search (DFS).
    ///
    /// This method assumes that the graph is acyclic, making the problem analogous to finding the diameter
    /// of an N-ary tree. If the graph contains cycles, the problem becomes NP-complete, and this method 
    /// will not provide a valid result.
    ///
    /// # Methodology
    /// The function traverses the graph recursively to calculate the longest path by identifying
    /// the two longest branches extending from each node. These branches are used to compute the longest
    /// road as the sum of their lengths.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// - `node`: The current node in the graph where the DFS starts.
    /// - `graph`: A `HashMap` representing the adjacency list of the graph. The keys are node indices,
    ///   and the values are vectors of connected node indices.
    /// - `visited`: A mutable reference to a `HashSet` that keeps track of visited nodes to prevent cycles
    ///   and redundant computations.
    /// - `longest`: The current longest path discovered during the DFS traversal.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// A tuple `(usize, usize)`:
    /// - The first element represents the height of the current DFS branch (i.e., the maximum depth from the `node`).
    /// - The second element represents the updated longest path across the graph.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    /// ```no_run
    /// use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};
    ///
    /// // Example graph (acyclic tree structure)
    /// let mut graph: HashMap<usize, Vec<usize>> = HashMap::new();
    /// graph.insert(0, vec![1, 2]);
    /// graph.insert(1, vec![0, 3, 4]);
    /// graph.insert(2, vec![0]);
    /// graph.insert(3, vec![1]);
    /// graph.insert(4, vec![1]);
    ///
    /// let mut visited = HashSet::new();
    /// let initial_longest = 0;
    ///
    /// // Assume `dfs` is implemented in the context of a struct with `self`
    /// let (branch_height, longest_path) = some_struct.dfs(0, &graph, &mut visited, initial_longest);
    ///
    /// println!("Branch height: {}", branch_height);
    /// println!("Longest path: {}", longest_path);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Complexity
    /// - **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges in the graph.
    /// - **Space Complexity**: `O(V)` due to the `visited` set and recursion stack.
    ///
    /// # Assumptions
    /// - The graph is connected and acyclic.
    /// - Nodes are represented as `usize` indices.
    ///
    /// # Notes
    /// - If the graph contains cycles, the method will not compute the correct result.
    /// - To extend this method for cyclic graphs, additional logic (e.g., cycle detection or pruning) is required.
    ///
    /// # Limitations
    /// - The method does not verify if the graph is acyclic; it relies on the caller to provide a valid input.
